Note that the learning rate used in previous section will no longer work here. You will need to search for an appropriate learning rate to get some converging behavior. Plot your MSE loss curve as a function of the epochs once you identify a convergent learning rate.\n",
        "Hint: the learning rate needs to be much, much,much, much, much, much, much smaller (think about each much as an order of manitude) than what was used in part 2). Also unless you let it run for a long time, it is unlikely to converge to the same level of loss values. So use a reasonable upper bound on the # of iterations so that it won't take forever."
